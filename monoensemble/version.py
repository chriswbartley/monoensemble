monoensemble
========
This package contains high performance implementations of 
MonoGradientBoostingClassifier and MonoRandomForestClassifier. These monotone
classifiers use the fast and scaleable monotone rule approach described
in Bartley C., Liu W., and Reynolds M. \Enhanced Random Forest Algorithms for
Partially Monotone Ordinal Classication". In: Proceedings of the Thirty-Third AAAI Conference on
Articial Intelligence (AAAI-2019), Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, Jan 27 - Feb 1 PREPRESS. ed. by
AAAI Press. AAAI. 2019.
